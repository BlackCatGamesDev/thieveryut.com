<div class="featuretextarea"><p class="featureheader">Torch Extinguisher</p>
<p class="featuretext">Simulating the unreliable nature of burning light sources, this adds some mystery to each extinguished torch. Was it a Thief or just the wind? The new Torch Extinguisher has two important advantages over the old TorchSnuffer mod: 1) each torch has an equal chance of being picked to be extinguished and 2) the round will start with a number of torches pre-extinguished, meaning Guards have a job to do right away if they want to keep the area fully lit.</p>
