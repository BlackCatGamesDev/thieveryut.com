Guards<p>

Helmet (Cost 60)<p>

This gives you better protection against the thieves' blackjack.  Without a helmet, a single blow to the back of the
head will knock you out.  Wearing a helmet means you can take 3 normal hits, or 1 heavy hit.<p>

Flare (Cost 50)<p>

Use the flare to light up an area to spot a troublesome hiding thief.  If a torch has been put out, simply touch a burning flare against
the sconce to relight it.  Note, you cannot use your weapons while holding a flare.  You can throw the flare to free your hands
and pick it up again if necessary.  The flare burns for 16 seconds.<p>

Mine (Cost 50)<p>

An explosive device that detonates when touched.  Put these around the target areas on the map to stop the thieves from
reaching their objectives.  You and your teamates can set these off too, so be careful not to tread on them.  Note, the
AI guards do not set these off.  The thieves can use their lockpicks to disable mines.  You can carry a maximum of 2 mines.<p>

Health Potion (cost 50)<p>

The guard starts with 125 health points.  When injured, drinking a health potion will restore 25 points.<p>

Speed Potion (cost 100)<p>

Drinking this will make you run twice as fast for 10 seconds, good for chasing thieves or to rush to guard the exit if the thieves have
completed their objectives.<p>

Caltrops (30 for a set of 3)<p>

A four spiked trap that hurts and paralyses a thief that treads on it.  Again, place these around key places, e.g. target items
or the exit point.  Guards can safely walk on these due to their thick metal boots, making these an ideal trap to place on
well travelled corridors linking important places.  The thieves can use their moss arrows to neutralise caltrops.
You can carry a maximum of 6 caltrops.<p>

Whistler Trap (Cost 120)<p>

This golden machine will light up and make a shrill whistle whenever a Thief gets near.  The thieves can disable whistlers
with a water arrow.  You can carry a maximum of 3 Whistlers.<p>

and pick it up again if necessary.<p>

Flashbomb (Cost 100)<p>

The flashbomb is thrown at the ground in front of an enemy, it will detonate with a bright flash that will temporarily
blind anyone who looks at it or is nearby.  Thieves are less affected than guards.  Try to aim the flashbomb in front
of the target, as it will blind them for longer.  Useful if guards are bunching up in an area, as it will blind them all.

Health Potion (cost 50)<p>

The thief starts with 100 health points.  When injured, drinking a health potion will restore 25 points.<p>

Breathing Potion (Cost 50)<p>

When underwater and running out of air, drinking this will restore your lungs full of oxygen, allowing you to
swim further underwater.<p>

Speed Potion (Cost 100><p>

Drinking this will make you run twice as fast for 10 seconds.  This is useful for escaping when caught red handed,
making a dash for an important item, or reaching the exit before the guards stop you.
