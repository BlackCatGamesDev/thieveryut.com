You need three things for your ladder:<p>

<ul>
<li> A solid wall for the player to push against:<p>
<img src="images/wallshot.jpg"><p>
<li> A ladder mesh to make it look good. E.g. one of Actor/Decoration/ThieveryObject/ThGizmosAndPlumbing/ThObjectLadder:<p>
<img src="images/laddershot.jpg"><p>
Make sure this mesh is close to the wall and has bBlockPlayers=false, it's only for decoration.  A quirk of the engine sometimes makes the taller meshes disappear from view when looked at at certain angles, so be careful.
<p>
<li> An Actor/ThLadder, this forms an invisible cylinder, whenever the player touches the cylinder they can move vertically up and down it.
It is displayed as a yellow ladder icon:<p>
<img src="images/overhead.jpg"><p>
The above shot shows the overhead view of the scene above in UnrealEd.  Ensure you have the Radii view turned on so you can see the circle
describing the ThLadder's collision cylinder.  Position the ladder so half of the cylinder covers the ladder as shown,
the other half being inside the wall.<p>
Now to position it vertically:<p>
<img src="images/frontshot.jpg"><p>
This is the ladder viewed from the front.  To make the ladder properly requires careful placement of the collision cylinder vertically.
Again, make sure the Radii view is turned on (showing the collision cylinder as a box around the icon, see red arrow) and place the collision cylinder as shown in the shot.
Notice the cylinder doesn't run the whole length of the ladder, the large gap at the bottom ensures the player will move out of the ThLadder
as he climbs to the bottom.<p>
	<ul>
	<li> The top of the cylinder should be exactly in line with the floor the ladder leads onto.<p>
		This ensures the player will step out of the ladder mode as he reaches the top of the ladder, climbing off.  It will also
		mean they can easily climb down the ladder from the above floor just by stepping off the edge.<p>
	<li> There should be a gap of 128 units between the bottom of the ThLadder and the floor.<p>
	
		Right click on the ThLadder and bring up it's properties, going to the Collision section:<p>
		<img src="images/ladderproperties.jpg"><p>
		You'll have to adjust the ThLadder's CollisionHeight and move it so the ThLadder stretches from the top, down the ladder, to 128 units above the ground.<p>
		
		This means as you climb down the ladder, when you reach the bottom you'll automatically leave the ladder mode and walk off, making climbing down ladders
		nice and easy.  To climb up them you have to jump at the ladder to connect to it.<p> 
	</ul>
</ul>


Here's a small <a href="Th-LadderTest.zip">example</a> map if you need it.<p>
