A Night At The Theatre

So who says a thief of my caliber can't enjoy a quiet evening's entertainment?  The ritzy theatre at the edge of the City is playing a favorite of mine, and I wouldn't mind a sitting in on an Act or two.

Of course, as luck would have it, 'business' kept me busy until well after the show was finished and the house was empty.  

But, as mom would say, 'when life gives you lemons, steal the oranges, too.' 

There's bound to be plenty of loose cash between the seats.  Those stuffy nobles always lose a bit at the shows.  I'll just sneak in, and pick up enough to pay for my next ticket in tomorrow night.  Odds are, the money will all be in the auditorium, which is no doubt guarded, so I'll need to find some alternate way inside.

I've heard rumors that this particular theatre has a history and a rather... unsettling... reputation.  It seems that it is built on an old burial ground.  It seems like everything worth going for IS in this city.  But that's not the end of it:

The back alleys have always had bedtimes stories of the cults that have grown and fallen over the years.  This theatre, I hear, is no different.  One of my 'business partners' tells me that underneath this seemingly innocent stretch of town is a network of undergound rooms, the home of one of these cults, and a particularly violent and curious one at that.  Still, I was told that there would probably be some kind of ancient 'magical' relics lying around just calling out for me to pocket, and I was promised a good price if I could bring back a few.  Shouldn't be too hard.

I don't believe in magic, but I've always wondered why Theatres had to be built at the edge of the City...
